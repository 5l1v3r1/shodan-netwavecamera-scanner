Hi 

first Greeting to all people who try to detect security VULN and work hard to fix it :)

On this new HowTo i will show you how you can scan for VULN detcted on Netwave IP Camera with shodan 


Let's start it :)


First of all you need to create account on shodan web site and get your API with it you ca scan and get all the hosted Netwave IP Camera Server 


it's my API  

API Key: fOG9FXEkOqbEO4kuGttJTCl14n4UHiRv

so next you need root for where you start scanning and script for scan you can found it on my Github 


Github Scanner : https://github.com/SecKiller/shodan-netwavecamera-scanner



let connecte to our root now that we got access to our root let git our script and start scanning 


befor start scanning you have to prepare you username and password list 


in my case i put less as i can i show you 


also you have to install some requement needed by the scanner 


to do this use this CMD  


pip install -r requirements.txt


you can check the content of the requirements.txt file to see the pre-requeste needed 


as you see all the requirements needed are already setup on my server so now let's start scanning for some VULN server 



to do this you have to execute the CMd Below 




python SecKiller-shodan-netwave-scanner.py -u usernames.txt -w passwords.txt -k fOG9FXEkOqbEO4kuGttJTCl14n4UHiRv -t Out-Wave.txt





i expain every part of the cmd 



-u  the path of your usernames file 

-w the path of your password list file 

-k your Shodan API Key 

-t the output file where all the scan result will be saved 

L'ets do it 

as you se scanner is connected to shodan service 


so for this line you have to answer yes 

] Disable password discovery module? (Yes/no):  yes 



The scan will take long time to finish its depend on your dork i will show you how to edit the dork on the scanner 


so in my case i already scanned some server let me show you the result :)

and test some login 

as you see we are in :)  

so for people who don't know for whats it's used this go first search about the NetWave and then came here again to start exploiting :)


also ad i told you i wil show you from where you can change your dork let's do it 


first start editing your scaner source code 

nano SecKiller-shodan-netwave-scanner.py


serach for this line 


parser.add_argument('-s','--search', dest='search', default='Your New Dork', type=str, help='Default Netwave IP Camera')

and edit this value default='Netwave'    dont remove the quote ''  just put your dork betwen the two quote like this 

and save your file ^:)


Hope you Enjoy this Howto
